What We expect out of contributors: Be Me. If you are not me then your behavior is completely unacceptable, and no code changes
will be merged into my code.

What We expect out of forks: Be you. That fork is your code now, do what you want with it.

Should I be telling you to be tolerant of other people's cultures, lifestyle, gender, and generally don't be in irritating jerk: Do you
really not understand this already? If not, then: Don't be an irritating jerk who insults people's cultures, lifestyles, gender, etc. This
won't get you on the team for the main codebase. as the primary qualification to contribute is to be me, just generally don't be rude.
This is common sense.
